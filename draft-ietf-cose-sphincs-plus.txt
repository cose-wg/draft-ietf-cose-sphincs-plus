1.  Introduction

   This document specifies JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
   [RFC7515] and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052]
   serializations for the Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature
   Standard (SLH-DSA), which was derived from Version 3.1 of SPHINCS+, a
   Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) based digital signature scheme
   standardized in [FIPS-205].

   This document builds on the Algorithm Key Pair (AKP) type, as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium].  The AKP type enables flexible
   representation of keys used across different post-quantum
   cryptographic algorithms, including SLH-DSA.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The SLH-DSA Algorithm Family

   The SLH-DSA Signature Scheme is parameterized to support different
   security levels.

   This document introduces the registration of the following algorithms
   in [IANA.jose]:

4.  SLH-DSA Keys

   Private and public keys are produced to enable the sign and verify
   operations for each of the SLH-DSA algorithms.

   The SLH-DSA Algorithm Family uses the Algorithm Key Pair (AKP) key
   type, as defined in [I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium].  This ensures
   compatibility across different cryptographic algorithms that use AKP
   for key representation.

   The specific algorithms for SLH-DSA, such as SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s, SLH-
   DSA-SHAKE-128s, and SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f, are defined in this document
   and are used in the alg value of an AKP key representation to specify
   the corresponding algorithm.

   Thumbprints for SLH-DSA keys are computed according to the process
   described in [I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium].

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7515], [RFC7517] and [RFC9053]
   apply to this specification as well.

   A detailed security analysis of SLH-DSA is beyond the scope of this
   specification; see [FIPS-205] for additional details.

   The following considerations apply to all parameter sets described in
   this specification.

5.1.  Validating Public Keys

   All algorithms that operate on public keys require validation before
   use.  For sign, verify and proof schemes, the use of KeyValidate is
   REQUIRED.

5.2.  Side-Channel Attacks

   Implementations of the signing algorithm SHOULD protect the secret
   key from side-channel attacks.  Any implementation of SLH-DSA signing
   algorithms SHOULD employ at least the following best practices:

   *  Constant-time operation

   *  Consistent instruction sequence and memory access

   *  Uniform sampling without information leakage

5.3.  Randomness considerations

   All nonces MUST originate from a trusted and cryptographically secure
   source of randomness.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New COSE Algorithms

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the COSE Algorithms
   Registry.
