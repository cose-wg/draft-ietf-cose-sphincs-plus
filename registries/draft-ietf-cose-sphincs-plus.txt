                       SLH-DSA for JOSE and COSE
                  draft-ietf-cose-sphincs-plus-latest

Abstract

   This document describes JOSE and COSE serializations for SLH-DSA,
   which was derived from SPHINCS+, a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
   based digital signature scheme.  This document does not define any
   new cryptography, only seralizations of existing cryptographic
   systems described in [FIPS-205].  Note to RFC Editor: This document
   should not proceed to AUTH48 until NIST completes paramater tuning
   and selection as a part of the PQC (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/
   post-quantum-cryptography) standardization process.

1.  Introduction

   SLH-DSA is derived from Version 3.1 of SPHINCS+, as noted in
   [FIPS-205].

   SPHINCS+ is one of the post quantum cryptography algorithms selected
   in [NIST-PQC-2022].

   TODO: Add complete examples for SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-
   128s, SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f... ( all of them? really?)

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The SLH-DSA Algorithm Family

   The SLH-DSA Signature Scheme is paramaterized to support different
   security level.

   This document requests the registration of the following algorithms
   in [IANA.jose]:

4.  SLH-DSA Keys

   Like ML-DSA keys, SLH-DSA keys use the AKP Key Type.

   The thumbprints for SLH-DSA keys are also computed according to the
   process described in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium]

5.  Security Considerations

   The following considerations SHOULD apply to all parmeter sets
   described in this specification, unless otherwise noted.

   Care should be taken to ensure "kty" and intended use match, the
   algorithms described in this document share many properties with
   other cryptographic approaches from related families that are used
   for purposes other than digital signatures.

5.1.  Validating public keys

   All algorithms in that operate on public keys require first
   validating those keys.  For the sign, verify and proof schemes, the
   use of KeyValidate is REQUIRED.

5.2.  Side channel attacks

   Implementations of the signing algorithm SHOULD protect the secret
   key from side-channel attacks.  Multiple best practices exist to
   protect against side-channel attacks.  Any implementation of the the
   Sphincs+ signing algorithms SHOULD utilize the following best
   practices at a minimum:

   *  Constant timing - the implementation should ensure that constant
      time is utilized in operations

   *  Sequence and memory access persistance - the implemention SHOULD
      execute the exact same sequence of instructions (at a machine
      level) with the exact same memory access independent of which
      polynomial is being operated on.

   *  Uniform sampling - care should be given in implementations to
      preserve the property of uniform sampling in implementation and to
      prevent information leakage.

5.3.  Randomness considerations

   It is recommended that the all nonces are from a trusted source of
   randomness.

6.  IANA Considerations
